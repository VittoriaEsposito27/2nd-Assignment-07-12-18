# QUICKSORT AND MERGESORT REPORT
#I have tried to implement mergesort and quicksort functions, given in the slides. The main implementation is to write one single function for both mergesort and quicksort. In both cases, the first thing to do is to check if the given list has more than one element: if yes, the list has to be sorted; if not, the functions return the initial list.
